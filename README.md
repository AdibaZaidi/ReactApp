![Dashboard Screenshot](screenshot.png) <!-- Replace with an actual screenshot of your dashboard -->

## Description

This project is a dynamic Data Visualization Dashboard created using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The dashboard allows users to visualize and analyze data from a JSON file through interactive charts and visualizations. Users can apply filters to explore different aspects of the data, gaining insights into various metrics.

## Features

- Interactive Data Visualization: Utilize D3.js, Chart.js, or other visualization libraries to create dynamic charts and visuals representing data metrics.
- Filter Options: Implement end year, topics, sector, region, PEST, source, SWOT, country, and city filters for customized data exploration.
- Backend Server: Develop a Node.js and Express backend to handle data retrieval from the MongoDB database.
- Frontend Interface: Create a user-friendly React frontend with an intuitive layout for seamless interaction.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the dashboard is responsive and accessible across various devices.
- Deployment: Deploy the backend on Heroku or a similar platform, and the frontend on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
